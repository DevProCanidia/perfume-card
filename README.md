## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use the decoration text css property called line-through to cut the text in half.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This complete css guide helped me a lot in creating the layout and position of the elements.
